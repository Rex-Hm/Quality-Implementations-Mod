# blocks description
block.q-impl-phase-fabric-conveyor.description = Transports items forward. Faster than a titanium conveyor.
block.q-impl-surge-alloy-conveyor.description = Transports items forward in batches. Accepts items at the back, and unloads them in three directions at the front. Requires multiple loading and unloading points for peak throughput. Faster than a Plastanium conveyor.
block.q-impl-reforced-router.description = Distributes input items to 3 output directions equally. Faster than a standard router. (Yeah, routers have speedLimit.)
block.q-impl-reforced-distributor.description = Distributes input items to 7 output directions equally. Faster than a standard distributor. (Yeah, distributors have speedLimit.)
block.q-impl-reforced-bridge-conveyor.description = Transports items over terrain or buildings.
block.q-impl-reforced-unloader.description = Unloads the selected item from nearby blocks. Faster than a standard unloader.
block.q-impl-accelerator.description = Increases the speed of nearby buildings. Optionally uses silicon to boost range. Ideal for defenses.
block.q-impl-mend-dome.description = Repairs blocks in its vicinity. Optionally uses silicon to boost range.
