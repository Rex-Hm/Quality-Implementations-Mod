block.better-distr-phase-fabric-conveyor = Phase Fabric Conveyor
block.better-distr-surge-alloy-conveyor.name = Surge Alloy Conveyor
block.better-distr-reforced-router.name = Reforced Router
block.better-distr-reforced-distributor.name = Reforced Distributor
block.better-distr-titanium-bridge-conveyor.name = Titanium Bridge Conveyor


block.better-distr-phase-fabric-conveyor.description = Transports items forward. Faster than a titanium conveyor.
block.better-distr-surge-alloy-conveyor.description = Transports items forward in batches. Accepts items at the back, and unloads them in three directions at the front. Requires multiple loading and unloading points for peak throughput. Faster than a Plastanium conveyor.
block.better-distr-reforced-router.description = Distributes input items to 3 output directions equally. Faster than a standard router. (Yeah, routers have speedLimit.)
block.better-distr-reforced-distributor.description = Distributes input items to 7 output directions equally. Faster than a standard distributor. (Yeah, distributors have speedLimit.)
block.better-distr-titanium-bridge-conveyor.description = Transports items over terrain or buildings.
